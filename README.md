# deep_rob final project

We are reproducing the dpf and trying to compact the the model to get it to work on a Mbot (small mobile robot with limited compute)

An reproduction of the differentiable particle filter described in this paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11122.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11122.pdf)
